# HDSC-life-tables
These files are used to create yearly overviews of the enslaved population by age from the slave registers for Suriname and Curaçao. 

For each year the mutations by age are also listed, so that the qualitity of the data can be checked. These events are:
- birth / registration
- death
- diseased (sent to the lepra colony)
- escaped
- manumission
- written off (clerical correction)

The source files are available at the IISH Data Verse via:

Please be aware that mortality in Curaçao seems to be underregistered in most years and corrected, that is overregistered, in other years.
