# HDSC-life-tables
These files create yearly overviews of the number of enslaved individuals in the slave registers by age from the slave registers for Suriname and Curaçao. Enslaved individuals are counted per 31 December, except for 1863, when they are counted at manumission at 1 July 1863.

For each year the mutations by age are also listed, so that the qualitity of the data can be checked. These events are:
- birth / registration
- death
- diseased (sent to the lepra colony)
- escaped
- manumission
- written off (clerical correction)

Please be aware that mortality in Curaçao seems to be underregistered in most years and corrected, that is overregistered, in other years.
